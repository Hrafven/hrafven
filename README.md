# Hi ! I'm Hugo Bidois

I have been in software development since 2015 and just became a master's degree graduate in compute science.

I have been working with [iCom Business Services](https://icom-cloud.com/) - since April 2019 in a 10 weeks intership and a one year in a pre-professional contract - on the [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) platform and [Marketing Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/overview/)
