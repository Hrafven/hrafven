# Hi ! I'm Hugo Bidois

I have been in software development since 2015 and just became a master's degree graduate in compute science.

I have been working with [iCom Business Services](https://icom-cloud.com/) - since April 2019 in a 10 weeks intership and a one year in a pre-professional contract - on the [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) platform and [Marketing Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/overview/)

## About me

I'm interested in :
- Apex, Salesforce, Marketing Cloud ‚òÅ
- [v language](https://vlang.io/)
- Flutter
- Docker & Virtualisation
- Badminton üè∏

I'm looking to contribute on any OSS project aside with my game project.

## My game project

Crow in the Throne Room is a Hack 'n' slash rogue-like RPG with co-op project. It is still in early design phase and development hasn't started yet.
I'm looking for help with building character, level, world design and modelling. I'm also open to contribution from developers using OpenGL/Vulkan and vlang.
